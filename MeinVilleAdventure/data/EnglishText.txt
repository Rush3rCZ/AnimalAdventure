A legend has it, that in a peaceful village Meinville lives a dark force.
A force which was never seen yet.It slept during the day, however every
night it was sneaking around the houses like a fog. It was probably 
destined that Jack went to the mountain stream that one night.
He didn't come back. Did he get lost or did he drown? - No. Because 
now the mysterious force attacked. There was nothing left after Jack,
nothing but an  empty shell-a body without soul and life. In the
morning, they found the boy by the river. They managed to wake 
him up but he wasn't the same as before. Everyone began to fear of
him, so they locked him in an old abandoned mill  on the other side
of the river. Since then, strange creatures began to appear
around the village, threatening her. Right in this moment you're
entering the story our hero. You have to enter the mill and destroy
the force living in Jack, forever. GET FOUR PIECES OF THE KEY, which
Jack was imprisoned with. LISTEN TO THE VILLAGERS AND YOU WILL FIND
THE KEY.
Good luck!
